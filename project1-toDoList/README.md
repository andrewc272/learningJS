- A button to delete tasks.
2. Add Event Listeners:
- Handle the "add Task" button click to add a new task.
- Handle task complestion and deletion with buttons or checkboxes.
3. Local Storage:
- Save tasks in `lovalStorage` so that even after refreshing, the tasks are still there.
- Update `localStorage` whenever tasks are added, completed, or deleted.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- Add task to the list.
- Mark a task as complete.
- Remove a task.
- Save tasks to `localStorage` and retrieve them on page load.

**Challenges:**
